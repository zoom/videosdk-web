* Audio and video not reconnecting properly on failover
* Error code not being sent correctly when no server responds to connection requests

### Known Issue:
On Chromium, video stops playing and goes black when resolution changes to or from 720p. This is caused by a bug in Chromium, which is due to be fixed in Chrome 101, scheduled for release at the end of April. To work around this, you may reduce resolution below 720p; alternatively, if you’d like to continue using 720p, it may help to add a button or messaging to the user to toggle their video on and off
  
## v1.2.0

### Added:
* Support for [Cloud Recording](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/video/web/essential/recording)
* Limited support for [720p video send](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/overview/720p)
* Support for call out
* Support for command channel / real-time data
* Improved role management
  * *The user who created a session is considered the "original host". The original host has the following privileges: the session ends after a configurable timeout after the original host leaves a session, if a new host was not assigned. When the original host rejoins the same session later, if nobody was assigned as the new host by the original host before they left the session, the original host can claim the 'host' role, based on its user_identity setting in the JWT payload. The original host can take the host role at any time from the current host. See user_identity and role_type in [Authentication](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/sdk/video/auth) for details.*
* Interface to disable session timeout
  * *Previously, the Video SDK session would end after being idle for 48 hours. This interface enables you to choose to disable the timeout and allow the participants to be idle for an unlimited period of time. The new parameter is an unsigned int sessionIdleTimeoutMins. The default value is 40 minutes.*

### Fixed:
