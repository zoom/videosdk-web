# Zoom Video SDK for Web

Use of this SDK is subject to our [Terms of Use](https://explore.zoom.us/en/video-sdk-terms/).

The [Zoom Video SDK](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/web/) enables you to build custom video experiences with Zoom's core technology through a highly optimized WebAssembly module.

## Installation

In your frontend project, install the Video SDK:

```bash
$ npm install @zoom/videosdk --save
```

## Usage

![Zoom Video SDK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoom/videosdk-web-sample/master/public/images/videosdk.gif)

> The Video SDK provides video, audio, screen sharing, chat, data streams, and more, as a service. You can build with all of these features, or pick and choose. The Video SDK also comes with a full set of server side [APIs](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/rest/reference/video-sdk/methods/#overview) and [Webhooks](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/api/rest/reference/video-sdk/events/#overview).

In the component file where you want to use the Video SDK, import `ZoomVideo` and create the client.

```js
import ZoomVideo from '@zoom/videosdk'

const client = ZoomVideo.createClient()
```

Then init the SDK and declare the `stream` which we will define later:

```js
client.init('en-US', 'Global', { patchJsMedia: true })

let stream
```

Now we will start or join the session.  Here are the required parameters for the `client.join()` function.

| Parameter              | Parameter Description |
| -----------------------|-------------|
| topic  | Required, a session name of your choice or the name of the session you are joining. |
| token  | Required, your [Video SDK JWT](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/auth/). |
| userName | Required, a name for the participant. |
| password | Optional, a session passcode of your choice or the passcode of the session you are joining. |

Then start or join the session and define the stream, which will be used for [core features](#core-features).

```js
client.join(topic, token, userName, password).then(() => {
  stream = client.getMediaStream()
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log(error)
})
```

Now that we are in a session, we can start using core features like `stream.startVideo()`.
